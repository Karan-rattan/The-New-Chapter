<h2 class="firstrip">When I landed in Germany</h2>
    <div class="trip1">

        <h3 class="text">I went to Germany with my uncle to visit his friend who had been staying there for a while now. He picked us up in his car and we met his entire family, I played with their dog BOBO it was a short trip because my uncle went there for a business meeting , so I spent most of the time with my uncle's friend and his family, though we went to see “Cologne Cathedral” the third largest church in the world it was beyond beautiful and I loved the people in Germany, this was my first time ever sitting on a plane and the excitement was indeed on its peak.</h3>

        <h3 class="text">This was a life changing trip, I flew to Canada as an international student, studying outside my county was like a dream come true to me , the moment I landed here my friends picked me up and took me to their house and asked me to instantly change clothes and get ready for a surprise, Tired and exhausted I changed my clothes and sat in the car for an endless drive to Canmore, The moment I reached there all my tiredness converted into excitement because they organized a camp site in Canmore to welcome me, We ate, danced had fun with all the other friends invited over their and stayed in tents for that night I loved such a warm welcome and could never forget that day.</h3>

    <div class="trip1">
        
        <h3 class="text">This day was my friends birthday, after two hours of long drive we planned to do his favourite task for his birthday “Shooting” we planned to go for outdoor shooting but due to weather we had to switch to indoor shooting but that was fun as well I shorted 2 mags of AK47 and Two pistols I loved it a lot because I too am fond of shooting and weapons. We stayed in HYATT for that night and enjoyed drinking and eating there, this was the best birthday ever celebrated in my friend group.</h3>
